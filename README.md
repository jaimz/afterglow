# Afterglow
A personal design system project implemented using Microsoft's FAST design system construction kit. Components are organised as follows:

## Design-tokens
Fundamental tokens use through the rest of the system - colours, type, grid units etc.

## Frame
Components used to (visualy) organise other components: windows, panels, master-detail, etc.

## Indicate
Components used to display information, but which aare not necessarily interactable. Progress bars, meters, charts etc.

## Interact
Components you can interact with: buttons, sliders, textfields etc.

## Utils
Stuff everything else uses.
